# Automotive-Model-Recognition-System
We are exploring the possibility of using algorithms to identify the make and model of a car given an image. Quickly identifying vehicles has become increasingly useful for various applications across industries and public services. For urban planning and traffic analysis, city planners can leverage these algorithms to more efficiently collect data on local vehicle makes and models. This data can inform decisions around construction projects, incentives for electric vehicles, gas taxes, toll infrastructure, and parking needs. Additionally, law enforcement agencies have used cases for automated vehicle recognition. Investigators could use these algorithms to aid in identifying stolen vehicles across camera feeds. The technology may also assist officers in tracking suspects based on car make and model sightings. Beyond municipal services, managed parking garages can enable automated entry/exit tracking per vehicle using image recognition. By cataloging entry and exit events per vehicle, these algorithms can remove labor needs for vehicle identification and charging. This would allow garages to instantly calculate appropriate parking fees as well as maintain better records. The system can snapshot each vehicle entering and leaving rather than relying on manual validation of tickets.
