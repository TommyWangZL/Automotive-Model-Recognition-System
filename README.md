# Automotive-Model-Recognition-System
Introduction and Motivation: 
Our project aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to accurately identify the make, model, and model year of various automotive vehicles from an image. We believe our project is significant because it will have a wide range of applications that can significantly reduce human labor and the cost of operations. For instance, law enforcement agencies could implement a vehicle recognition system on public roads to detect and monitor stolen vehicles or those flagged by authorities. Similarly, a seamless toll collection system on public roads and parking garages could eliminate the need for manual labor and printed tickets, relying instead on algorithmic vehicle recognition and timestamping.

Approach and Methodology: 
To develop our automotive recognition system, we adopted a semi-supervised learning approach using a pseudo-labeled dataset. Initially, we evaluated three pre-trained models—GoogLeNet, ResNet50, and Vision Transformer (ViT)—to determine our baseline model. Utilizing the Stanford Cars Dataset found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-cars-dataset, comprising 16,000 images across 196 classes, we standardized the data by adjusting labels to zero-based indexing and ensuring uniformity in image dimensions, RGB format, and pixel value distribution through preprocessing techniques. Following model selection, we employed the Optuna Library with random search for hyperparameter tuning, achieving an accuracy exceeding 80% after fine-tuning ViT. Our subsequent steps involve addressing data scarcity concerns by creating a pseudo-labeled test set with a confidence score threshold of 0.99 and augmenting the dataset with both the pseudo-labeled test set and the original training set. We then retrain the model using the optimized hyperparameters to attain a final accuracy of over 84%.
TODO:
Data scarcity remains a primary challenge, necessitating the exploration of additional labeled and unlabeled datasets for training purposes. The use of a pseudo-labeled test set for training raises concerns regarding potential data leakage and overfitting, highlighting the need for careful validation and early stopping techniques. To enhance the model's robustness and adaptability, we propose incorporating periodic retraining intervals, ensuring its compatibility with evolving automotive landscapes. By integrating the latest datasets, validating the model rigorously, and implementing preventive measures against overfitting, we aim to further enhance the accuracy and applicability of our automotive recognition system.
